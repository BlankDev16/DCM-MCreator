# Curseforge Description
(With total permission from FantasyWasTaken15 (or FantasyDev) AND some of her textures she handed to me)

One of the best underrated content mods i found for fabric, it's now discontinued. So, Fantasy asked me if i could continue her mod in a FORGE version. So i did.
PLEASE READ: I AM NOT THE FULL OWNER OF THE MOD. I'M JUST PROGRAMMING IT, AND FANTASY HANDED ME ALL OF THE PLANS SHE HAD.
(ily fantasy <3)
Our current general plans are:
- Take the crafting table to it's limits
- Make your vanilla experience a lot longer

- Those tears of joy from getting a high-tier ore, we need to make them tears of sadness because every week a new ore is gonna be added (and also a higher tier)

- Make your tears of sadness tears of fright because our main goal is to reach 1000 ores or more (what am i even doing with my life)

- Make YOU have fun mining and killing all the things.

 

We need you to have FUN. That is the most important thing.

 

(install Just Enough Items for crafting recipes, do NOT ask for recipes in the comment section please)

Getting started in the mod >>>

 

It's hard to get started with all of those things to do, but i assume you have a little bit of experience playing minecraft, so here we go.

PHASE 1: UNOBTAINIUM
You can get unobtainium by crafting it. There's currently no other way for that.

 

Crafting for two Unobtainium Gems

 

After you got some unobtainium, you can search for Verum Dust, Basis Ingot, Pilus Ingot and Secondium in the mines below layer 30, so you can craft some low-tier items- i mean, base-tier items. (they're bad compared to other things lmao)

PHASE 2: BASE-TIER ITEMS (soon!)
